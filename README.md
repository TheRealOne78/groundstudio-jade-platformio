# PlatformIO profiles for GroundStudio's Jade development boards

> [!CAUTION]
> The GroundStudio Jade Pro Micro profile is still untested, and using it may cause unexpected issues.
> Proceed with caution!

## Description
This repository provides support for GroundStudio's Jade development boards, enabling easy integration with PlatformIO for development. The repo includes the configuration files necessary for PlatformIO to recognize and work with the following boards:
- Jade Nano+ [N1+]
- Jade Uno+ [U1+]
- Jade Pro Micro (**UNTESTED**)

As of the time of writing (April 27th 2025), all other GroundStudio Jade development boards are fully compatible with their original counterparts, so creating separate profiles for them is unnecessary â€” you can simply use the profiles of the original boards.

## Setup Tutorial
### Unix-based systems (GNU/Linux | macOS | BSD | etc)

1. Ensure PlatformIO (Core) is installed.

   If you don't have `platformio` installed, follow the instructions here: [https://platformio.org/install](https://platformio.org/install).
3. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TheRealOne78/groundstudio-jade-platformio.git --recursive
    ```
4. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```sh
    cd groundstudio-jade-platformio
    ```
5. Run the setup script to configure everything:
    ```sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

### Windows
> [!NOTE]
> For **Windows systems**, the setup is still a work-in-progress.  Please follow the Unix setup for now, but be aware that Windows support is being developed.
